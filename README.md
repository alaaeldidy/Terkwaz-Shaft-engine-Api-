# Terkwaz-Shaft-engine-Api-
I used shaft engine Api  using Eclipse and java

I can get random cat fact and assert that text in response body is not empty or null
and also to get the response body in acertain File called="reponsedata.json";

I put all comman functions in one class called Commanpage and also I put URL in properties file and its 
path = C:\Users\Lola\eclipse-workspace3\ShaftApiTerkwaz\src\test\resources\Properties\urltest.properties

I put the functions in one class  called Allfunctions so that i can put all other functions inside it and call them .

 
 By using shaft engine it generates a report and ascreenshot
